# 🚴 Adventure Works Sales & Returns Analysis – Power BI Project

## 📊 Overview
**Adventure Works**, a renowned bike manufacturer and retailer, provided their **Sales** and **Returns** data for analysis. This end-to-end data project involved **importing**, **cleaning**, **modeling**, and **visualizing** data using **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**.

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
The raw dataset consisted of **8 CSV files**, each representing a distinct table. The cleaning process was conducted within Power BI and focused on:

- Renaming columns for clarity  
- Correcting and standardizing data types  
- Verifying the absence of missing data  
- Identifying and preparing relationships across tables  

> **Primary focus:** `Sales Data` and `Returns Data` tables

---

## 🧱 Data Modeling
After data cleaning and validation:

- Established primary tables: **Sales Data** and **Returns Data**  
- Created **one-to-many relationships** between tables  
- Designed a **logical data model** to support analytical goals  

📌 *A visual representation of the data model was created within Power BI for reference.*

## 🧠 DAX Functions & Measures
To extract actionable insights, **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** functions were used extensively. Key functions include:

- `SUMX`: Iterates over a table to calculate and sum row-wise values  
- `CALCULATE()`: Creates custom filter contexts for dynamic metrics (e.g., previous month's sales, profit, return rate)  
- `RELATED()`: Pulls related values from other tables  

### 📅 Date Functions:
- `DATEADD`, `DATESINPERIOD` for calculating:  
  - 90-Day Rolling Profit  
  - Month-over-Month comparisons  

➡️ All custom measures were centralized in a **dedicated Measure Table** for easy access and maintenance.
